            "instructions": "STEP 1:\r\nStart by brewing a cup of your favorite strong coffee or a shot of espresso; for a better-tasting result, you’ll want it to be as fresh as possible, so consider grinding your own beans for your brew.STEP 2:\r\nThen, add the crushed Oreos (save a few cookie crumbs — you’ll need them later!), chocolate chips, milk, chocolate syrup, and coffee to the blender and pulse until the mixture is smooth. Feel free to use whatever milk you prefer; whether you opt to use whole milk or vegan-friendly nut milk, the mocha cookie crumble frappuccino will still be creamy and delicious.\r\n\r\nCookie Ingredients \r\nSTEP 3:\r\nOnce your mixture is evenly blended, add your ice to the blender. Remember, the amount of ice you use will determine how thick your drink will be, so keep that in mind as you decide whether one cup or two is best. Blend until the mixture thickens.\r\n\r\nBlended Frappuccino\r\nSTEP 4:\r\nPour your blended coffee drink into a glass, and top it with whipped cream and crushed Oreo cookies. For an extra burst of sweet goodness, drizzle a bit of chocolate syrup on top of it, too — absolutely delicious.\r\n\r\n",

            "ingredients": "2 tbsps Nescafe Instant Coffee I use 2 tbsps per person, but you can adjust to taste when you mix with water or milk.\r\n1 tsps sugar you can make the coffee sugarless if you like, this is just a guideline.\r\n1 tsps water for whipping\r\nadd ice & cold water to fill the glass",
            "instructions": "Mix the instant coffee with water and sugar.\nWhip by hand or with an electrical hand held mixer. Usually if making 1-2 servings you can easily mix by hand as shown in the video, but if making more coffees it's preferable to use the hand held mixer.\nSee post for more instructions on technique and when to realize that coffee cream is ready.\nAdd to tall individual glasses, add ice and cold water. The traditional Frappe only requires cold water on top of coffee and ice. Mix well and let it rest a minute or two so it get frothy on top.\nIf you are preparing any variations of Frappe, then add milk or ice cream to taste. See post for more details.",
