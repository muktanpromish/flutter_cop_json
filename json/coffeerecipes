Froth the milk: Use the espresso machine or a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth milk into small, even bubbles. You’ll want lots of “dry foam” for a macchiato: the fluffy stuff! The milk frother is great for this type of foam.Spoon the foam on top: Use a spoon to remove the top of the foam (dry foam) and gently place it on top of the espresso.
